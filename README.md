# Why-Not-Focus
A java shader app made using Processing that turns information overload and its hindrance in productivity into a 2D movement struggle.


"You are distracted, you are available"

Why Not Focus is an interactive sketch that embodies the issue of information overload and how it hinders one's ability to focus on any kind of productive activity. 

The idea of productivity is symbolized by mouse movement, which moves the cursor with some friction accompanied by an erosive blackout of the rest of a normally flashing screen with images of all sizes flying towards the user.
